Autodesk Eagle settings and libraries

## OpenGL batch file

If you run into Error:
> "There is a problem running WebGL on this machine. As a result, packages will be rendered as wireframes, and large components may slow down performance.
> 
> For more information on WebGL, visit WebGL.org or check your graphics card compatibility. For Windows machines, a suggested workaround is described on the EAGLE forum."

modify eagle3D.bat to point to Eagle installation. Point the .sch and .brd files to be opened with the .bat file. You can change the icons using FileTypesMan:
